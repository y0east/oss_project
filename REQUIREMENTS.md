## Functional Requirements
1. User can log in using studentId and password  
2. Session-based authentication (not token-based)  
3. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) posts  
4. Each post contains a title, content, author, and timestamp  
5. Users can view a list of posts  
6. Users can view detailed information of a specific post  
7. All data is stored in a MySQL database  
8. API endpoints will return data in JSON format for frontend integration  
9. Error handling and response codes follow RESTful API conventions  

## Non-Functional Requirements
* **Database**:
  The database must be backed up daily to prevent data loss.
  All data should be securely stored with protection against unauthorized access.

* **Usability**:
  APIs must provide clear and consistent JSON responses.
  Appropriate HTTP status codes should be used to clearly indicate success or error states.

* **Maintainability**:
  Development must follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, with particular emphasis on the **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**.
  The system should be designed to allow extension without modifying existing code.
